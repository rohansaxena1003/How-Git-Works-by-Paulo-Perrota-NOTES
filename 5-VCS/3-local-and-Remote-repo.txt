code .git/config // This command gives the info about local 
                 // and remote branches.

Like a local branch, a remote branch is just a reference 
to a commit.

git show-ref <branch-name> // This command shows the 
                           // occurrence of this name in 
                           // local and remote repos.

Whenever you synchronize with a remote, git updates the 
remote branches.
Lets see how this synchronization happens in practice.
