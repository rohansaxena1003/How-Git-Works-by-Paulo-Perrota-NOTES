We use git clone command to copy a project from a remote repo to 
our local computer.

This command also the .git directory from the remote repo to the 
local repo.

Git clone only copies the main branch of the remote repo and we
need to give special commands to copy other branches to our local
repo.

We can multiple repos(1 on cloud and multiple on local repos) to 
have exactly the same content. All these repos are equally worthy 
from a technical P.O.V but the remote repo is generally considered
to be the main repo.
