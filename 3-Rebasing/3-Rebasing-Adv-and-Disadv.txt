REBASING 
    ADVANTAGES
        1.  Rebasing helps to refactor the project history so that it always 
            looks nice.
            

    DISADVANTAGES
        1.  Rebasing is a destructive operation. It creates new commits and 
            the original commits are garbage collected.

        2.  It can cause unwanted side effects. 

        3.  A scenario related to "DISTRIBUTION" makes rebasing less useful.

        4.  Mindless rebasing can lead to trouble. So, when in doubt, just merge.
