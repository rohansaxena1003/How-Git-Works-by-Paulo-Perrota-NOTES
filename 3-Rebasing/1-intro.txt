Rebasing is not common in VCS(Version Control Systems). 
Only a handful of VCS have it. Git is by far the most 
popular VCS to have it.


Rebase the current branch from its base and moves it 
to the top of the target branch. Thats 
why its called a 'rebase'. Like in merge, we might 
have to solve conflicts to complete the rebase.

A rebase can be fast-forwarded just like a merge.
