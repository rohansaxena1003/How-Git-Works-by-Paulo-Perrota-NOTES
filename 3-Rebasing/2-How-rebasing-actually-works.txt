As we mentioned earlier, rebasing is done by detaching 
the current branch from its base and moving it to the top 
of the target branch.
But, we know that commits are database objects and they 
are immutable.
So, how does rebasing actually work in practice ??
    When you rebase, git makes copies of the commits.
    It creates these new commits with exactly the same 
    data except for their parents and except for any 
    conflicts that you might have to fix during the rebase.

Remember that REBASING is an operation that creates new commits.

The original commits are garbage collected in most of the cases.
