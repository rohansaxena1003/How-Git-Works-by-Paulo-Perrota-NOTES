The command git branch lists all the branches and the 
current branch is marked by an asterick(*).

HOW DOES GIT IDENTIFY THE CURRENT BRANCH ?  
    Go to .git/HEAD 

    The above command has the name of the current file.

WHAT IS HEAD ? 
    HEAD is just a reference to a branch.

SWITCH BRANCH 
    The command git switch <branchname> is used to change the 
    current branch.
    
    1.  This means HEAD now points to this switched 
        branch (The HEAD folder now contains the hash for this 
        new branch.) 
    
    2.  Also, our working area is changed to the content pointed
        at by the "new branch".

    switch is specifically used for changing branches, unlike
    checkout that also does other tasks.
