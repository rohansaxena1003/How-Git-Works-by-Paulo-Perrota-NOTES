MERGES
    ADVANTAGES
        1.  Merges never lie, i.e., they preserve history of the commits 
            exactly as they occurred.


    DISADVANTAGES
        1.  Merges can be very complicating to understand especially in 
            a large project. 
        
        2.  Also, git log doesn't give a clear picture of how the commits 
            were made in the project. We need a git visualizing tool to 
            to comprehend the project.
