How to Find branches in the folder ?
    We can kind hash keys for all the branches by going to 
        .git/refs/heads

    This path will take us to all the branches(hashes)

What are branches ?
    A branch is just a reference(pointer) to a commit.

    Thats why the directory that contains branches is called 
    "refs".

    "Main" branch is just a branch like any other branch. It 
    does not have any special staus.
