This course is created by Paolo Perrotta.
It explains the inner working of git.
Basic working knowledge of git is recommended for going
through the course.
Here I have created the notes for the course.
My recommendation is to refer while watching the videos
and once you done so, these notes will act as a lifetime 
guide to revisiting Git basics.
