TAGS 
    A tag is like a label for a commit.
    Annotated tags have addtional information like metadata.

    SOME SYNTAX -
        git tag <tag name> -a -m "Message" // Creates a tag with a message
        git tag // gives list of tags 
        git checkout < tag name > // switches to the tag name
        
        .git/refs/tags // we go to the tags folder
        cat <tag name> // we get SHA-1 hash for the tag.
        git cat-file -p <SHA-1 hash> // we get metadata for the tag.

    A git tag is a reference. So, a git tag cannot contain data, just a name.

ANNOTATED TAGS vs LIGHT-WEIGHT TAGS 
    ANNOTATED TAGS 
        ANNOTATED TAGS are a branch-like object that point to a tag object that
        points to a commit.


    LIGHT-WEIGHT TAGS 
        LIGHT-WEIGHT TAGS just point to a commit because they don't need a place 
        to put those addtional metadata, so it doesn't need a tag object. It just 
        needs a name. 

        They are almost identical to branches.


BRANCHES vs LIGHT-WEIGHT TAGS
    The only diiference between Light-weight tags and branches is that they are 
    in different directories and git knows that it needs to treat them differently.

    For example, if I am on a branch and I create a new commit, the branch will 
    move to track that new commit but the tag will stsy attached to the original 
    commit. So, BRANCHES move but TAGS don't move.
