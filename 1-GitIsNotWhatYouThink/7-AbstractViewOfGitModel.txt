Blobs contain data.
Trees contains blobs and other trees.
The entire git structure is recursive.
The name of the blobs and trees are not in the blob or tree 
itself. Instead they are stored in the containing trees(parent 
tree). So you can have a particular blob(or tree) pointed to 
at by multiple parent trees.

So, Git is a high level file system built on top of your native
file system.
