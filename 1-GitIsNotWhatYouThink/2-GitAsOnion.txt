Git has 4 layers and we will learn about each layer.

    1.  Git is called "Distributed Revision Control System".
    2.  Imagine git is not distributed at all. Imagine there 
        is only one computer in the world and there is only 
        one repository on that compter. So git becomes "Revision 
        Control System, no distribution". This system still 
        includes history, branches, merges etc.
    3.  Lets forget about branches, merges, history etc. So now 
        git becomes "Stupid Content tracker". It tracks files, 
        directories.
    4.  Now forget even about tracking files.Forget about the
        notion of a commit. Forget about versioning. So now we see 
        that git is just a "map", a simple structure that maps keys 
        to values.

    We will go inside out(4 to 1) and understand each layer of git 
    in detail.
