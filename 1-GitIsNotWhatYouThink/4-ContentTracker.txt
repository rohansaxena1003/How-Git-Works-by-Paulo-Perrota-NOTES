We don't see git as just a map, but much more than that, 
we see it as a tool to track our files and directories, 
that is , as a 'Content Tracker'.

BLOB 
    A blob is really not a file. A blob is the content of the file.
    The file name and file permissions are not stored in the blob.
    They are stored in the tree that points to the blob.

If you have same content as somebody elses', then you get the 
same hash.

A commit is also just a piece of content like the content of our 
blob. As we have different content for each commit(like date-time,
author name etc.), therefore we get a different hash for each 
commit.
