Fork - It's kind of like a clone but it's a remote clone.

        We are cloning the project from someone else's 
        github account to our own github account.


UPSTREAM and PULL REQUESTS
    Example-
        We fork a project to our github account from someone else's 
        account. Now we clone this forked project to our local repo.
        Here the origin points at the remote repo of our forked 
        repo and not the original project(that is somebody else's).
        So here, we need to create another remote to the orginal 
        project so that we can track the changes made by the original 
        author. 
        In this case, we use a github feature called "UPSTREAM".

        So we can push changes to origin/main and track any changes 
        to the original project by pulling from the remote repo.
        We still can't push changes to the original project(upstream). So,
        there's an alternative to it. We can send a message to the 
        maintainers of upstream and ask them to pull our changes to their 
        repo. This is  called a "PULL REQUEST".
